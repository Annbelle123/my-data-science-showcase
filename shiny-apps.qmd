## 🚀 What is Shiny?

**Shiny** is an R package that allows you to build interactive web applications directly from R. With Shiny, you can create apps that allow users to interact with data and visualizations in real time.

You don't need to know JavaScript or other web technologies—just R! Shiny handles the web part for you, so you can focus on your data and logic.

## 🛠️ How Shiny Works

A Shiny app has two main components:

1.  **User Interface (UI)** – This is what the user sees and interacts with. It includes buttons, sliders, charts, tables, etc.
2.  **Server** – This is where the R code runs. It processes the user’s inputs (like clicking a button or changing a slider) and updates the UI accordingly.

### How It’s Structured

-   **UI**: You design the layout and elements (like inputs and outputs).
-   **Server**: You write the code that reacts to user inputs and updates the UI accordingly.

Basic structure of a Shiny app:

```{r}
 library(shiny)

# Define UI

ui <- fluidPage( sliderInput("num", "Choose a number", 1, 100, 50), plotOutput("plot") )

# Define server logic

server <- function(input, output) { output$plot <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$num)) }) }

# Run the app

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
