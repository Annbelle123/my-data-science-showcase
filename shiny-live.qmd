## 🚀 What is Shinylive?

**Shinylive** is a new way to run Shiny apps **without needing a server**. Normally, Shiny apps rely on a server to run R code and show the results. But with Shinylive, everything happens **right inside the web browser**.

That means you don’t need to use a service like `shinyapps.io` or set up a server. You just upload your app like a normal website, and it works.

Shinylive is called "serverless" because there's nothing running in the background.

-   **Not for large data** – browser-only apps can slow down with too much data.
-   **Sessions aren’t saved** – everything resets when the page is refreshed.
-   **Some R packages won’t work** – only ones that work with WebAssembly are supported.
